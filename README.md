THIS BACTH FILE IS INTENDED FOR WINDOWS ONLY

THE MAIN FEATURE OF THIS BATCH FILE IS TO CHANGE YOUR DESKTOP WALLPAPER, PROVIDED BY THE FOLDER YOU ADDED AND THE IMAGES INSIDE THAT FOLDER.

ANDD.
THATS IT.

instructions: 

YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE THE DIRECTORY OF THE BACKGROUND PICTURES
change the "C:\Users\user\Pictures\YourPictures" part for goodness sake.
CHANGE TO THE DIRECTORY YOU WANT, I PREFER THE FOLDER AND THE PICTURES ARE STILL IN THE C: DRIVE
EXAMPLE: set "folder_path=C:\Users\Admin\Documents\AnimePictures"
Example above shows that the folder is located in a documents folder.

note: sometimes when you run the batch file, it does not work automatically, idk why.
Im fixing it rn.
